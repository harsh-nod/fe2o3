# fe2o3-lower-mir-kernel

`fe2o3-lower-mir-kernel` owns a bounded in-memory detached lowering core from
the feature-gated `mir` dialect shell to target-neutral
`kernel.algorithm_root` operations. One verified kernel algorithm root is
materialized for each supported MIR function, in source order. The raw Pliron
core is private to this crate.

The accepted source is deliberately narrow. A source must be one verified
`mir.module`; its direct children must be `mir.func` operations; and every CFG
block may contain only its canonical `mir.block` marker followed by
`mir.return`. All traversal is bounded before recursive Pliron verification.
Any unsupported operation, malformed structure, exhausted source bound,
unsupported rank, or exhausted rewrite bound is a terminal typed error. The
service has no fallback path and never reports a result after failure.

The public V1 conformance facade accepts only pointer-independent module and
function recipes. It creates, registers, validates, and destroys a private
Pliron context for each run. Successful results retain only the immutable
configuration and a pointer-independent observation of module identity,
function identity and ordinal, argument type references, canonical block
identifiers, and admitted MIR operation order. They expose no `Context`,
`Ptr<Operation>`, registration hook, target operation, or structural replay
admission. The record is not a durable MIR identity, equivalence proof,
artifact identity, or authorization.

Inside the crate, postcondition validation rechecks both live source evidence
and every emitted kernel operation before a pointer-independent observation can
escape. Raw results and registration markers are bound to a private,
context-owned `fe2o3-pliron` identity anchor. Equal arena slots, transplanted
markers, and erased handles fail closed with typed errors before foreign or
stale pointers can be dereferenced.

The crate does not choose a GPU or physical target and contains no AMDGCN,
COMGR, `pliron-llvm`, compiler, linker, artifact publication, loader, launcher,
tuning, proof-authority, runtime, filesystem, process-execution, or unsafe-code
surface in its own source. Pinned Pliron remains part of the memory-safety
trusted computing base.

This crate deliberately does not expose or implement Pliron's `Pass` trait.
The internal lowering core materializes detached operations outside the source
root, which is not a legal in-tree pass rewrite. Tests use the versioned
pointer-independent conformance facade; production compilation uses the
separate semantic KIR APIs exported by this crate.
