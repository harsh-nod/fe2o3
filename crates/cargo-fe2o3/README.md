# cargo-fe2o3

`cargo-fe2o3` coordinates the current fe2o3 build and smoke-test workflows.
The adjacent `fe2o3-rustc-wrapper` is fail closed for compile invocations while
its trusted execution boundary is built incrementally.

## Pinned rustc executable

The wrapper now contains a private pinned-executable primitive for a future
native `rustc` execution path. On Linux it:

- opens the selected path read-only with `O_NOFOLLOW`, `O_NONBLOCK`, and
  `O_CLOEXEC` so a FIFO or device cannot stall validation;
- requires a non-empty regular file with execute permission and a size no
  larger than 512 MiB;
- hashes exactly the opened object's reported length with SHA-256, rejects
  short reads, growth, and metadata changes during hashing, and rewinds it;
- retains the opened descriptor; and
- constructs commands through a validated `/proc/self/fd/<fd>` reference whose
  lifetime is tied to the retained descriptor.

Compile execution is still disabled. The primitive is not used by bootstrap
passthrough or compile plans yet.

## Pinned codegen-backend object

The wrapper also contains a private Linux primitive for the codegen-backend
dynamic-library object. It applies the same final-component `O_NOFOLLOW` and
nonblocking source-open policy, requires a non-empty regular file no larger
than 512 MiB, and copies exactly the source bytes into an anonymous memfd while
hashing them. It rehashes the image, applies and verifies immutable
write/grow/shrink/seal seals, drops the writable descriptor, and retains only a
read-only `O_CLOEXEC` descriptor.

A prepared child command rejects pre-existing joined, split, underscore, and
response-file backend selectors. It appends one descriptor-backed selector and
uses a child-only `pre_exec` step to revalidate the image and seals before
clearing `FD_CLOEXEC`. The prepared command borrows the pin and exposes no
argument mutation, so the selector cannot be replaced after preparation.
Compile activation and dynamic loading remain disabled.

## Platform and trust limits

Linux with a trustworthy, mounted procfs is the only supported execution
strategy. Other Unix systems and Windows return an unsupported-platform error;
they must not fall back to reopening the selected pathname. The current
strategy is intended for native `rustc` binaries. Interpreter scripts can fail
when the descriptor is close-on-exec and are outside this boundary.

The rustc executable descriptor prevents pathname replacement from redirecting
execution, but does not make its writable inode immutable. The backend memfd
does provide an immutable snapshot after successful capture, so later source
pathname replacement or inode mutation cannot change child-visible bytes.
Parent-directory symlinks are resolved during each initial source open, and a
race before that open can choose which object is measured. SHA-256 becomes
authentication evidence only after an orchestration layer compares it with a
trusted expected digest.

ELF interpreters, transitive shared libraries of either rustc or the codegen
backend, dynamic-loader search and loading behavior, procfs mount/identity
semantics, and the kernel remain outside these primitives' boundary. The
backend descriptor may also remain visible to rustc descendants until an
activation design closes or resets it. Pinning the backend object does not pin
its shared dependencies.
