# Unsafe Code Policy

The target is safe public APIs with a small, reviewed hardware/OS implementation
boundary, not zero `unsafe` keywords. KFD MMIO, mappings, custom ioctls, raw device
memory, ABI exports, and some process setup require explicit contracts. Moving
these operations into generated strings, C, dependencies, or larger unsafe blocks
does not discharge those contracts.

## Source Inventory Gate

The normal `cargo-fe2o3` test suite, already run by `scripts/ci-local.sh`, checks
`scripts/unsafe-source-baseline.json`. The check tokenizes every tracked and
non-ignored untracked Rust source and compares per-file, per-kind counts against
the reviewed baseline. Comments and literals are excluded; test code,
feature-disabled code, and macro templates are included. Templates are counted
once where written, not once per expansion. Unreadable or untokenizable files
fail the check.

The inventory requires a Git checkout; it is not a source-archive test. Run the gate:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p cargo-fe2o3 --test unsafe_source_policy
```

After reviewing a deliberate addition or removal, refresh and review the diff:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p cargo-fe2o3 --test unsafe_source_policy \
  refresh_reviewed_unsafe_inventory -- --ignored --exact
git diff -- scripts/unsafe-source-baseline.json
cargo test --locked -p cargo-fe2o3 --test unsafe_source_policy
```

Do not increase a baseline merely to make CI pass. A new unsafe operation needs
an explanation of why safe APIs cannot express it and a reviewed invariant.
Reductions also update the baseline, preventing an old allowance from remaining
available. Counts are a review aid, not a proof: replacing an operation without
changing its kind/count still needs normal code review. Generated Rust strings,
doctests, dependency implementations, and native C/C++/assembly are outside this
source inventory and remain part of the system's trust boundary.

## Implementation Rules

- Keep pure compiler, simulator, debugger-engine, and profiler-analysis modules
  unsafe-free, using `forbid(unsafe_code)` where the crate boundary supports it.
- Prefer existing safe typed OS APIs. Keep descriptor ownership in `OwnedFd`,
  `BorrowedFd`, `File`, or another owner; do not scatter `borrow_raw` conversions.
- Preserve exact descriptor identity, symlink policy, CLOEXEC, publication,
  locking, error, and teardown behavior during replacements.
- Keep hardware and process boundaries narrow and document why each unsafe
  operation's lifetime, aliasing, initialization, ABI, and concurrency
  requirements hold. Post-fork callbacks need async-signal-safety review even
  when the functions they call are individually safe Rust.
- Do not remove unsafe traits or raw-launch preconditions without replacing
  their guarantees. Extend checked/generated APIs to reduce caller obligations.
- Retire HIP/HSA qualification code only after its users and test coverage have
  replacements. Default production execution remains direct KFD.
- Test ownership and failure behavior, including compile-fail tests where
  applicable. Host tests supplement but do not replace GPU/MMIO validation.

## Initial Reduction

The initial audit of `d9f6bbcd0` found 1,924 source sites in 288 Rust files:
1,026 in non-test crate source across all configurations, 874 in tests/fixtures,
and 24 in examples/benchmarks. This includes legacy qualification code, not just
the default production build. The checked-in baseline records the current
post-reduction counts without requiring a GPU to reproduce them.
