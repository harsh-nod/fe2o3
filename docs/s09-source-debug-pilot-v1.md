# S09 source-debug pilot V1

This pilot preserves source metadata for the authenticated General V3 `alpha`
kernel on exact target `gfx942:xnack-`. It is enabled only by Worker V2
configuration value `s09-alpha-gfx942-o0-v1`, which requires COV6, `O0`,
`strip-debug=false`, and per-stage LLVM verification.

The profile is deliberately closed. The compiler requires the checked-in alpha
source identity, function at line 68, index statement at line 69, local `i` at
line 70, and the exact
`f32`, read-only slice, and `DisjointSlice<f32>` argument profile. It emits
DWARF for:

- function `alpha` and its source file/line;
- scalar argument `scale`;
- the physical slice components `input_data`, `input_len`, `output_data`, and
  `output_len`; and
- scalar local `i` after the trusted global-index operation.

Rust slice and `DisjointSlice` values are represented by their physical
pointer/length components. Aggregate reconstruction, structs, tuples, arrays,
optimized debugging, arbitrary source profiles, and user-provided debugger
commands are unsupported. Requesting the profile with optimization or debug
stripping fails before compiler execution. A source, ABI, SSA-shape, target, or
pre-existing debug-metadata mismatch fails before Worker V2 publication.

The O0 profile emits three fixed compiler-internal `s_nop 0` debug witnesses.
The line-68 staging witness assigns kernarg setup to the function line, the
line-69 witness keeps the five physical ABI values live for argument
inspection, and the line-70 witness keeps `i` live for local inspection. These
witnesses are not source inline assembly and are never accepted from user
input. They are an intentional code-generation cost of this exact debug
profile.

The compile test emits one COV6 HSACO and requires `llvm-dwarfdump --verify` to
accept its linked DWARF. The fixed ROCgdb runner and transcript checker are a
separate debug evidence boundary. The runner accepts only an absolute HSACO,
the fixed hardware-test executable, and a fresh archive directory. It invokes
native `/opt/rocm/bin/rocgdb-py_3.12` with literal batch commands and accepts no
debugger command, init file, or command environment input. It inspects the
function at line 68, all five physical arguments at line 69, and `i` at line
70. A missing or unavailable required observation fails even when ROCgdb exits
zero.

Pilot evidence classes are:

- `unit`: metadata injection, source-shape, and checker mutation tests;
- `ui`: closed Worker V2 configuration admission and rejection diagnostics;
- `compile`: genuine rustc/LLVM/LLD COV6 emission plus DWARF verification; and
- `debug`: normalized `llvm-dwarfdump` and native ROCgdb archive inspection.

This pilot is not production parity evidence. S09 remains `Missing` until a
production debug result is signed and accepted by the parity gate.
